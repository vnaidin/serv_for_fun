Playing with Express.js on old osX10.7.5 as server

April 2020: the server autogenerates the .m3u file, which can be accessed from localhost:3030/playlist

To run the server:
1. npm install
2. npm start


//TODO:
1. add channel categories => music,sport,films etc.
2. refactor the code, now it is working => but it's a shit
